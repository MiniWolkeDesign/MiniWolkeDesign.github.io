## About MiniWolkeDesign

MiniWolkeDesgin is a one-person studio. I design my products by taking multiple cultural ideas and every possible material into account. My 3D printer helps me to create my idea in real form. Everything in the shop is originally designed by me, printed by me, and also finished by me. The accessories here are like my kids and hope you like them as well.
